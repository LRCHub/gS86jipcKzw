```lrc
[00:00.05] Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
[00:05.37] About nothing and everything, all at once
[00:11.52] I am one of those melodramatic fools
[00:16.76] Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
[00:23.14] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[00:29.33] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[00:34.04] It all keeps adding up
[00:36.61] I think I'm cracking up
[00:39.21] Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
[00:58.71] 
[00:48.01] I went to a shrink, to analyze my dreams
[00:53.63] She said it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
[00:59.24] I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
[01:04.29] So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
[01:10.49] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[01:16.37] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[01:21.06] It all keeps adding up
[01:23.60] I think, I'm cracking up
[01:26.13] Am I just paranoid?
[01:28.75] I don't know
[01:34.75] 
[01:40.56] Grasping to control
[01:44.80] So I better hold on
[01:54.30] 
[02:08.89] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[02:14.11] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[02:18.69] It all keeps adding up
[02:21.27] I think I'm cracking up
[02:23.84] Am I just paranoid?
[02:26.19] Or am I just stoned?
