[00:00.05] Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
[00:05.24] About nothing and everything, all at once
[00:11.38] I am one of those melodramatic fools
[00:16.75] Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
[00:36.25] 
[00:23.20] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[00:28.63] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[00:33.84] It all keeps adding up
[00:36.28] I think I'm cracking up
[00:38.95] Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
[00:58.45] 
[00:47.83] I went to a shrink, to analyze my dreams
[00:53.13] She said it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
[00:58.59] I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
[01:04.05] So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
[01:28.05] 
[01:10.36] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[01:15.88] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[01:20.73] It all keeps adding up
[01:23.12] I think, I'm cracking up
[01:25.81] Am I just paranoid?
[01:28.15] I don't know
[01:34.15] 
[01:39.86] Grasping to control
[01:44.33] So I better hold on
[01:53.83] 
[02:07.82] Sometimes I give myself the creeps
[02:13.34] Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
[02:18.01] It all keeps adding up
[02:20.47] I think I'm cracking up
[02:22.82] Am I just paranoid?
[02:25.43] Or am I just stoned?
